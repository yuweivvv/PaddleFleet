"""Activation-gradient magnitude metrics for PaddleFleet.

Pure tensor functions, no monitor state. Everything returns a 0-dim GPU tensor so
the caller hands it straight to ``record_layer_metric`` without a D2H sync --
hot-path discipline: see ``.claude/skills/monitor-hook-perf-rules``.

The quantity being measured is dL/d(activation) at a module's *output*, i.e. the
gradient that flows back into that module. This is the backward-path counterpart
of ``massive_act``'s forward-path magnitudes, and the positions are named to
match so a gradient curve and its activation curve line up in the viewer.

# - ``norm_mb``     one microbatch's *complete* tensor, i.e. summed back over
#                   whatever shards the same tensor (SP / CP / SP-in-TP), then
#                   averaged over microbatches and data ranks. Equals ``norm``
#                   exactly on a layout that does not shard activations.
# - ``rms_global``  sqrt(sum g^2 / sum N) over every rank and microbatch. The
#                   only one of the six that is invariant to cluster size,
#                   parallel layout and gradient-accumulation depth.
# - ``norm_global`` sqrt(sum g^2) over every rank and microbatch, i.e. the whole
#                   global batch. Closest in spirit to the optimizer's global
#                   grad norm, but it grows like sqrt(world_size * gas), so it is
#                   only comparable within one cluster shape.

# problem). Those two want opposite fixes, so the token axis gets its own series.
#
# The token axis, not the channel axis, is the right decomposition here:
# ``massive_act`` splits activations per channel because massive activations are
# a channel phenomenon, while gradient spikes are usually carried by individual
# tokens.
#
# All four are exact across ranks with no collective: every position is a
# post-projection full-hidden tensor, so each rank holds *whole* tokens and a max
# over ranks is a max over all tokens. ``token_outlier_ratio`` is a fraction

    for both ``[B, S, H]`` and ``[S, H]`` layouts without being told which it got.

    - ``token_norm_max``      the loudest token's ``||g_t||``
    - ``token_norm_p99``      the tail's shape; its distance from the max says
                              whether the spike is one isolated token or many
    - ``token_norm_ratio``    ``max / median``, the token-level peakiness --
                              the counterpart of ``massive_act``'s
                              ``channel_max_ratio``
    - ``token_outlier_ratio`` fraction of tokens above ``10x`` the median
    - ``token_zero_ratio``    fraction of tokens with no gradient at all

    **The median is taken over gradient-carrying tokens only.** A first version
    used the plain median and measured the wrong thing on a real 8k run:
    loss-masked positions gave whole rows of exact zeros, the median sat at ~0,
    and ``token_norm_ratio`` came out 2000-19000 -- a reading of *how much of the
    batch is masked* rather than of token peakiness. ``nanmedian`` over the
    non-zero rows restores the intended meaning, and ``token_zero_ratio`` exposes
    the masked fraction as its own series instead of letting it distort another.

    Costs one more full reduction than the scalar stats (``norm(axis=-1)`` over
    the whole tensor); the max / median / quantile that follow run on a vector of
    length ``tokens``, which is negligible. Materialising the squares to share a
    pass with ``mean_sq`` would cost a 4-byte-per-element temporary -- 268 MB on a
    43-layer 8k run -- so the second pass is the cheaper trade.
