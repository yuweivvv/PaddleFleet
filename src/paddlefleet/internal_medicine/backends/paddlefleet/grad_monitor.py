"""Activation-gradient health monitor for PaddleFleet.

Answers "where does the gradient grow or die on the way back" with one L2 norm
per module output per layer. Three positions per layer -- the attention branch
output, the MLP/MoE branch output, and the decoder layer output (the residual
stream itself) -- times the three magnitudes in ``grad_metrics``.

Collection is a ``forward_post_hook`` that registers a tensor gradient hook on
the module's output. The forward hook measures nothing itself: it exists only to
get hold of the tensor whose gradient is wanted, so the forward path pays one
``register_hook`` per module and the reductions all happen during backward.

**AMP.** A gradient hook sees the *loss-scaled* activation gradient, so the raw
numbers are the scale (order 1e4, and it moves on every overflow) times the
quantity of interest. ``finalize_scaled_grad_metrics`` divides the scale back out
once per step from ``on_optimizer_begin`` -- before ``optimizer.step()``, while
``scaler._scale`` still holds the value this step's backward actually used.
Without that step the curves would jump by 2x every time the scaler halves.

**Sharding.** No collective runs here (hot-path discipline: see
``.claude/skills/monitor-hook-perf-rules``); the cross-rank reduction happens at
flush time in ``gather.py``. Under TP / SP / CP each rank therefore measures its
own shard: ``rms`` is the true global value when shards are equal-sized, while
``norm`` is the per-shard norm -- a fixed ``1/sqrt(num_shards)`` of the global
one, so it tracks the same trend but is not the number a global grad-norm clip
would report.

**Recompute.** ``_should_monitor`` is False while grad is disabled, so the
discarded first forward of a recomputed block registers nothing and the replayed
forward -- the one whose graph actually carries the backward -- is what gets
hooked.

class ExactNormReducer:
    """Turns per-rank sums of squares into exact global norms, once per step.

    Why a collective at all: ``norm`` / ``rms`` are recorded per shard and then
    *averaged* across ranks, which is only an approximation of the global value
    (the arithmetic mean of per-rank RMS understates the true RMS by about half
    the squared cross-rank coefficient of variation). Summing squares instead is
    exact, but sums do not commute with sharding for free -- hence this.

    Where the collective goes: **flush time, one batched reduction per group**,
    never in a hook. A 43-layer stack with 3 positions and 6 microbatches would
    otherwise queue ~774 all_reduces per step, which is the exact failure mode
    ``monitor-hook-perf-rules`` was written about.

    Two independent sums come off the *same* local value:

    - **shard sum** over the groups that split one tensor -- ``cp`` always, and
      ``tp`` only under ``sequence_parallel`` (without SP the very same tensors
      are *replicated* across TP, so summing would multiply every squared norm by
      ``tp_size``). Feeds ``norm_mb``.
    - **total sum** over a group set that covers every participating rank
      *exactly once*. Feeds ``rms_global`` / ``norm_global``.

    The two are never chained. An earlier version reduced over ``cp`` and then
    continued on the same buffer over ``dp``, which silently assumed the two rank
    sets were orthogonal. On a ``sharding_first`` topology that assumption fails:
    with ``data_parallel_size=1`` the samples live on the sharding dimension, so
    ``_DATA_PARALLEL_GROUP`` spans ``cp`` and the context-parallel contribution
    got counted twice -- ``norm_global`` came out ``sqrt(cp)`` high (+41% at
    ``cp=2``) with nothing in the numbers to show it. Chaining was only ever
    correct by luck.

    So membership is *checked*, not assumed:

    - two mesh groups through this rank are orthogonal iff they intersect in
      exactly this rank; a candidate that overlaps an already-chosen group more
      than that is dropped rather than double counted,
    - the product of the chosen sizes must equal ``world_size / pp_size``. When it
      does not, ``norm_global`` is **suppressed** rather than emitted wrong: a
      partial cover makes it the norm of a sub-batch, while ``rms_global`` stays
      an unbiased estimate on any subset and keeps being reported.

    ``pp`` is never summed: its ranks own different layers, so their key sets
    differ and a reduction across them would deadlock on mismatched shapes.

        Most metrics this monitor owns are degree-1 homogeneous in the gradient,
        so one division fixes them -- and it is valid on the raw accumulator
        because both aggregations commute with a positive scale: ``sum(g_i)/S``
        is the mean of ``g_i/S``, and ``max(g_i)/S`` is the max of ``g_i/S``. The
        scaler updates ``_scale`` in its own ``step``/``update``, i.e. once per
        optimizer step, so every microbatch folded into these sums shared it.

        The ``token_*_ratio`` series in ``SCALE_INVARIANT_AGGREGATED`` are the
        exception: a ratio (``max/median``) and the token fractions are degree-0,
        so the scale already cancels and dividing again would shrink them by
        ``S`` (order 1e4 under fp16), wiping out the token spike / drop-to-zero
        signal they report. They are skipped here.

        Idempotent within a step: called from ``on_optimizer_begin`` when the
        trainer provides a scaler, with ``_flush_buffers`` as the fallback read
        point for direct users and non-AMP runs.
